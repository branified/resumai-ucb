# ResumAI

## Inspiration
Applying to different jobs posts has become a very difficult process. It is difficult to gauge the needs of recruiters who are looking at resumes.  It is also very tedious to rewrite resume each time to fit key words of companies, which has become important in order to align with the job description and stand out against competitors. This something that is lacking in the many other free platforms available, free being important as different positions in educational and professional paths require help and may not have access to personal career coaches or resources at an affordable cost.

## What it does
Given a job description and resume users are able to gain valuable feedback on their resume and how they can make the resume a good fit for the role. It gives insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the applicant's resume in relation to the job description. It gives the resume bullet points that they should fix and how they should fix it to fit the job description. And it gives questions that a interviewer may ask based on the resume and job description.

## How we built it
We are utilizing Node.js and the OpenAI API in the backend and React for the frontend to display the results.

## Challenges we ran into
We spent a lot of time finding the correct features for our target market and seeing what wasn't already available as we needed our product to stand out. We also had difficulty getting guaranteed structured responses from the OpenAI API and had to find a workaround in the front end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our main accomplishment is that we were able to create a working product which fulfills the requirements and is able to return successful results.

## What we learned
Through this hackathon, we learned how to work with the OpenAI API, and how to use it efficiently. We also learned the importance of interacting with sponsors and competitors to see how we can improve our product.

## What's next for ResumAI
We want to include a flashcard and self testing feature with a variety of potential interview questions to allow people to prepare for and be confident going into their job interviews. We also want to utilize the You API to search for job posting that are relevant to the user and show that in our project.
